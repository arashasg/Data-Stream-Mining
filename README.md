# Data-Stream-Mining
In this repository, I implemented two data stream 
processing algorithms. These algorithms are generally supposed 
to be fast and occupy limited memory space.
### Bloom Filter
The first algorithm  
I implemented is the Bloom filter, which filters data streams using
limited memory space.
### Flajolet-Martin Algorithm
The second algorithm implemented in this repository is the
Flajolet-Martin which is used to estimate the number of distinct
elements in a stream.
